# Code for building the Intelligent Tutoring System focused on solving first degree equations.

This project provides the resources and documentation to simulate, build the graphical user interface and perform statistical analysis of the intelligent tutoring system focused on solving first degree equations, using in the project the Jess-> ctat (Authoring Tool) rule language.The project hierarchy and folder description is as follows.

1. **client**:
   1. **public\CTAT\CognitiveModels**:reflect the contents of the working memory after the step is modeled, allowing us to inspect and modify the working memory of a cognitive model at any time
   2. **public\CTAT\FinalBRDs**: To record the monitoring behavior of the tutor, it also helps to map the solution space, or the scope of learner behavior that the cognitive model should consider. Associating the knowledge components with the steps in the graph provides an idea of the quantity and quality of the skills that will be modeled as production rules.
   3. **public\CTAT\HTMML**: Contains the views generated by CTAT HTML Editor, containing only the static views and styles provided by the CTAT engine, which are editable and updatable through the .ed extension.
   4. **src\components\UI**: It contains the graphical interface of the deployment components, written in TypeScript.
   5. **src\lib\helpers**: There are data validations, resource management and requests made in the ITS.
   6. **src\lib\hooks**: Contains api's that manage the distribution of fiscal years and resources directly to the states set up for deployment.
   7. **src\lib\page**: It manages a number of useful ITS components such as page components, routes and navigation between views.
   8. **src\lib\types**: The structure of all the components is defined as the parameters of a class.
2. **server**:
   1. **src\config**: It contains the structure defined for the VAK test.
   2. **src\errors**: They store error messages that may occur in the use of the ITS.
   3. **src\middlewares**: Used to intercept and modify data flow between components and application state.
   4. **src\models**: They store the structure of each class included in the database.
   5. **src\routes**: Contain the addressing that each component of the ITS will have.
3. **ProjectImages**. Some manuscript images, figures and animation for the `README.md` file.
